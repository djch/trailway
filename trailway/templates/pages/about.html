<h3>What is Trailway all about then?</h3>
<p>
  It's mainly about Dan â€” that's me ðŸ‘‹ â€” learning how to build a maintanble Django
  project, from scratch that has as few moving parts as possible. What it
  actually does as software isn't that important to me just yet. There's a few
  things I want to explore and try to understand fully:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing locally on OS X</li>
  <li>Self-service user sign-ups</li>
  <li>Payment plans via something like Stripe</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Later on I also want to look at:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Document editing with Trix</li>
  <li>More minimal CSS frameworks than Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
<p>
  At the end of the day this might just become a kind of project template to be
  cloned when starting something new. <code>Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</code>
</p>

    P.S. the name "Trailway" was picked at random from a bus stop in a movie I
    was watching.
